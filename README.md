# dronefactory

dronefactory is a Carrd style landing page for the artist [dronefactory](https://www.instagram.com/dronefactoryart/). I'll try to make it as complete as possible.  I used an existing Bootstrap-ready HTML theme that I heavily modified. This is a HTML/CSS project but some Javascript was involved.

## Installation

Just fork and adapt it to your needs

## Usage

You can access the result [here](https://dronefactory.space/)
